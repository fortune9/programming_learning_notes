Any widget made from any htmlwidgets package (e.g., plotly, leaflet, DT, etc) 
can be saved as a standalone HTML file via the htmlwidgets::saveWidget() function.

To load the saved htmlwidgets back to an html file, can one use the *iframe* tag.
For example, 

```
<iframe, src="widget.html" width="80%" height="80%"> </iframe>
```

Alternatively, one can save an htmlwidget via [saveRDS()] and then load it back
to an Rmarkdown document via [readRDS()].
