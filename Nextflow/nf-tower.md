## Deployment

### AWS

To deploy Nextflow tower to AWS, one need to follow the following 3
steps,

1.  Prepare AWS to have all the required elements, such as IAM roles,
    SMTP server, MySQL database, etc. [Check
    here](https://install.tower.nf/22.3/prerequisites/aws/).

2.  With that, one need to change the configuration files of tower.env,
    tower.yml, and docker-compose.yml to reflect the settings, including
    those set in step 1. [Check
    here](https://install.tower.nf/22.3/configuration/overview/).

3.  Finally, one can deploy the Nextflow tower enterprise, which
    includes download the tower docker images from Seqeralabsâ€™ ECR and
    run docker to start these images. [Check
    here](https://install.tower.nf/22.3/docker-compose/).
