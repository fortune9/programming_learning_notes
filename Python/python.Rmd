## Variables

### False values

- Empty list/string/tuple: Empty list/string/tuple are all false in ‘if’ test, so no need to test length



## Functions

## Classes


## Packages


## Modules

## Code testing

### Manual and automatic testing

There are manual and automatic testings. 
To automate testing, one can choose from CI/CD tools, including Travis CI, 
Travis CI service is available free for all public github repositories,
one can activate it by login to its website and authenticate with your github/gitlab
credentials, and then create a .travis.yml file in the repository, like:

```yaml
language: python
python:
  - "2.7"
  - "3.7"
install:
  - pip install -r requirements.txt # required packages
script:
  - python -m unittest discover
```

### Testing modules

One can use the “assert a==b” statement to
test a function, and can also use the modules like unittest, nose, nose2,
and pytest to test. To use these modules, the code has requirements, summarized as follows:

module | requirements | implementation
--- | :--- | :---
unittest | 1. put tests into a class as methods, 2. use the assertion methods from unittest.TestCase class instead of builtin assert | create a new class inheriting from unittest.TestCase, and then add methods to run tests. use unittest.main() to run the tests. One can also use ‘python –m unittest discover –s tests’ to test all test*.py files in the folder tests.
nose2 | the test script files need to be importable modules | when running “python –m nose2” it runs tests on all test*.py files in current folder.
pytest | have test functions’ names start with “test_” | pytest support buitlin ‘assert’ and resume from where failed, also many plugins to extend functionality. 


## Formatting

PEP8 is a guide for writing python code, defined in 2001, 
to increase the readability of code. There are two types of tools 
to enforce PEP8 compliance, linters and autoformatters. linters
 can check code for compliance to PEP8 and flag errors. One of them
 is flake8, which will provide comments/suggestions on the code.
 Autoformatter directly change your code directly to comply with PEP8,
and one of them is black. For more on PEP8, here is a good
tutorial: https://realpython.com/python-pep8/.

One can install editor extensions to help format code to comply
with PEP8. The vim plugin is at https://github.com/nvie/vim-flake8. 

One can use the following strategy to automate python code linting: 
(1) set a git pre-commit hook (https://pre-commit.com/, written in python, 
but having hooks for other languages too), so it will be triggered every
time when code changes, https://dev.to/m1yag1/how-to-setup-your-project-with-pre-commit-black-and-flake8-183k
(flake8 hook is at https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/user/using-hooks.html);
(2) set github actions so that it is triggered when push/pull requests
(or any defined actions) occur, see https://dev.to/ricardochaves/python-lint-with-github-actions-2i7p.

To add pre-commit hooks (isort, black, and flake8), one need the following steps: (1) install pre-commit package and add ‘pre-commit’ to “requirements.txt”, for python project only, (2) create .pre-commit-config.yaml (put at the root of git repo) and add hooks into it; this file defines repos where hooks can be downloaded and high-level options (see https://pre-commit.com/#plugins for more details on option specifications), (3) run ‘pre-commit install’ to install git hooks to .git folder. (4) if this is setup for existing repo, one can run ‘pre-commit run –all-files’ to format existing all files. Now it is all set, and when every time ‘git commit’ is run, the hooks would be triggered, black formats code, and flake8 checks it, if anything changes, the commit will fail and for you to review the changes by black, and then you can modify code and re-commit, until no more errors. Normally, these hooks will not prevent creating a commit, but to enforce it, one can run ‘git config --bool flake8.strict true’ to set the variable ‘flake8.strict’ to true, and in this way, flake8 needs be strictly followed. Also, one can create their own hooks by following instructions at https://pre-commit.com/#new-hooks. 

To have all git repos install pre-commit hooks automatically, one can run the following command:

```bash
git config --global init.templateDir ~/.git-template
pre-commit init-templatedir ~/.git-template
#pre-commit installed at ~/.git-template/hooks/pre-commit
```

And from now on, every time clone or init a repo, the pre-commit hook is installed there automatically. Otherwise, one need run “pre-commit install” to install hooks manually.


### PEP8 guideline summary

Nomenclature

Object | Recommendation | Example
--- | :--- | :---
Function, variable, method, module | Use lowercase words separated by underscores | x, my_fun, my_module.py
class | CamelCase: each word starts with capital letter and don’t use underscore | MyClass
package | Use short lowercase words, but not separated by underscore | mypackage

Layout

Object | Recommendation | Example
--- | :--- | :---
Top class, function | Two blank lines before them |
Method in a class | One blank line before them |
within function | Use blank lines to separate main steps |
max line length | 79 characters. For multiple line code, one can put code in parenthesis, brackets, or braces, or use backslash \ to connect lines. For a long string, one can make it by connecting multiple string segments with ‘\’ or ‘+’, or use () to enclose multiple lines. |
indentation | 4 consecutive spaces preferred over tab. For line continuation, one can use ‘hanging indent’ or ‘extra indent’ (align to open delimiter) to improve readability. |
closing brace | Align with first non-white character of previous line, or the first character of the construct. |
comments | Start with ‘# ’ (a space here), using complete sentence with first letter capitalized. Use inline comments sparingly unless necessary |
docstrings | Enclosed in triple double/single quotes, writing for public modules, functions, methods, classes. Put ending quotes on a single line itself, except for oneline docscript, which should all be in one line. | 
Binary operators such as =, <=, or, is, in | Add one white space on each side, but no space when assigning default value in function definition. Also add space to lowest operator only, e.g., * vs + | z = (x+y) * (x-y)


### flake8 configuration

One can put parameters in a flake8 configuration file, and in this way, one doesn’t need to specify the same parameters many times. Flake8 looks for configurations in the following places: setup.cfg, tox.ini, .flake8 in the project directory, and ~/.config/flake8 in user space, note that the former has higher precedence, and command line parameters have even higher precedence. The config files follow the INI format, starting with [flake8] for the section, and command line parameters can be used in config in either way: use underscore to replace hyphen, or simply remove leading hyphens. Also note that flake8 doesn’t support inline comments. An example flake8 configuration is like this:

```config
[flake8]
ignore = D203
exclude =
    # No need to traverse our git directory
    .git,
    # There's no value in checking cache directories
    __pycache__,
    # The conf file is mostly autogenerated, ignore it
    docs/source/conf.py,
    # The old directory contains Flake8 2.0
    old,
    # This contains our built documentation
    build,
    # This contains builds of flake8 that we don't want to check
    dist
max-complexity = 10
```

### Static type hinting

One can use the static type hinting format in function definition, such as

```python
def myfun(a: str, b: bool=True) -> str:
```

In this way, it tells what kinds of inputs and returns are expected for a function. To use type built-in data structure (List, Set, Dict, Tuple, Optional, callable, interators, unions), we can use typing package. For more advanced usage of types, including creating new types, like structures in C, one can see the module typing at https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html. One tutorial on the topic is at https://medium.com/depurr/python-type-hinting-a7afe4a5637e. One can also use mypy (from mypy package) to check whether a script is correct in static typing.

**Type hints summary**

Arguments typing |	Explanation
--- | :---
Def greeting() -> None:	| No return value for a function
*args: int	| args is a tuple of ints
*kwargs: float | Kwargs is Dict[str, float]
Names: List[str] | Names accept a list of str
Names: Iterable[str] | Any iterables of strings, such as list, set, tuple.
Id: Union[int, str] | Id accepts either int or str
Name: Optional[str]	| Equivalent to Union[str, None], i.e., accept str or None.
x: Tuple[str, float, int]=(“hi”, 3.5, 3) | X is a 3-element tuple with three types
x: Tuple[int,…] | Variable size tuple of ints
x: Callable[[int,int],float]=fun | A function accepts two ints and return a float
def g(n:int) -> Iterator[int]: | Return an iterator, such as generator function
x: List[Union[str,int]]=[3,”s”,4] | X is a list having mixed elements of str and int. 
X: Any = anyType()	| X can be any type, used when too complicate for typing
X = “smot”  # type: ignore | Suppressing type checking for this line
f(mp:Mapping[int,str])->None | Here mp is a dict-like data, so call it as f({3:’a’, 5:’b’}), for mutable mapping, use ‘MutableMapping[]’.
x: MyClass = MyClass() | Use user-defined class ‘MyClass’ as a type.
Seats: ClassVar[int]=4 | Use ‘ClassVar’ type to annotate a class variable.
X: Match[str]=re.match(‘\w+’,”_abc_”) | X is a regex match object
X: IO[str] = sys.stdin | X is a filehandle by using IO type


## Performance test

To test performance after each change, one can also set up tests, or use the pytest plugin pytest-benchmark.

## Some useful modules and packages

- bandit: To test security flaws in your code, one can use the ‘bandit’ package. This can also be included in a setup.cfg for CI/CD tools

- mmap: one can use the module mmap to represent file as memory-mapped file objects, which behaves like both bytearrays and file objects, so one can use the methods from both classes. mmap uses virtual memory to handle big files and can allow multiple processes to access the same data with shared memory (fileno=-1, not compatible with multiprocessing module, for which use shared_memory module instead). mmap object has many methods as file objects have and also have find and rfind methods to search subsequences in the whole file. But in terms of efficiency, mmap may not be faster than regular read/write all the time, depending on the file size (mmap performs better in larger files) and specific operations. Also mmap object can be used as a string, so operations like regular expression can be also used on it. There are four access mode for mmap, ACCESS_READ, ACCESS_WRITE, ACCESS_COPY, and ACCESS_DEFAULT. The ACCESS_WRITE mode writes both to memory and underlying file, while ACCESS_COPY only writes to memory and not to file
